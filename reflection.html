    <h3> About me and my Credentials: </h3>
    <p>The purpose of this page is to reflect on infomration about myself and my job history. </p>
    <p>I spent 2 years at Moberly Area Community college working towards my associates degree and currently have it. This experience was a shocking change from high school and I believe that this experience helped make me more independent as a person. This experience also greatly assisted me in business and economic knowledge since all of my classes primarily focused on these topics.

    <P>I have a job history </P>
