    <h3> About me and my Credentials: </h3>
    <p>The purpose of this page is to reflect on information about myself and my job history. </p>
    <p><img src="images/macc.png"> </p>
    <p>I spent 2 years at Moberly Area Community college working towards my associates degree and currently have it. This experience was a shocking change from high school and I believe that this experience helped make me more independent as a person. This experience also greatly assisted me in business and economic knowledge since all of my classes primarily focused on these topics.
    </p>
    <P>My job history has taught me many different things and that is reliability, the importance of showing up on time, how to work for long periods of time, and how to act responsible in a workplace. </P>
    <p>My experience at MACC has taught me a level of independence when it comes to making sure that I get work done and that I do it effectively. I do believe if I didn't take classes at MACC I would not have this level of independence and reliability.
