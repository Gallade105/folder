    <p> Hi, my name is Alec Schuetz, and I am 21 years old. I was born in <em>St. Louis Missouri and grew up in Columbia Missouri.</em> <br />My favorite thing to do is play video games, and I'm very passionate about it. I love gaming on my computer so much that I even built my own computer and I use it to play my favorite games like Dead by Daylight. I work part-time at a gym as a Janitor to help save money for after college. I really enjoy listening to podcasts and audiobooks while I work and Star Wars books are usually my favorites. I graduated from Hallsville high school in 2018 and haven't visited Hallsville since then. I graduated with my 2-year degree from MACC, and I’m working towards my 4-year degree at Mizzou. I still have no idea what I plan to major in and it's the one thing I still can’t pick. </p>

        <p>I spent 2 years at Moberly Area Community college working towards my associates degree and currently have it. This experience was a shocking change from high school and I believe that this experience helped make me more independent as a person. This experience also greatly assisted me in business and economic knowledge since all of my classes primarily focused on these topics.
     </ul>
