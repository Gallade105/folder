    <p>Hi, my name is Alec Schuetz, and I am 21 years old. I was born in St. Louis Missouri and grew up in Columbia Missouri. I work part-time at Body Refinery Gym as a Janitor to help save money for after college. I graduated from Hallsville high school in 2018 and haven't visited Hallsville since then. I graduated with my 2-year degree from MACC, and Iâ€™m working towards my 4-year degree at Mizzou.
